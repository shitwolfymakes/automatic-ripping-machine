"""Phase 12 — per-job log query + bug-report zip endpoints.

Two read-only endpoints scoped to a single `job_id`:

- `GET /api/logs/{job_id}` — NDJSON stream of every line tagged with
  the requested `job_id`. Sourced from `/logs/jobs/{job_id}.log`
  (written by `LogTailer`); falls back to scanning `/logs/*.log` when
  the per-job file is absent (legacy jobs predating the tailer's
  per-job append). `?limit=N` caps the line count.

- `GET /api/logs/{job_id}.zip` — in-memory zip. Single entry sourced
  from the per-job file when present; legacy fallback walks the
  service logs and writes one entry per service. Per-entry caps:
  `ARM_LOG_ZIP_PER_ENTRY_LINE_CAP` lines or `ARM_LOG_ZIP_PER_ENTRY_BYTE_CAP`
  bytes (env-tunable; defaults: 5000 lines / 5 MB), whichever hits first.

Both endpoints require a UI JWT — service-token callers are rejected.
The download URL the UI hardcodes is `/api/logs/{jobId}.zip`; there's
no global "give me the bug-report URL" diagnostics field, because the
URL is per-job and we don't want to thread `?job_id=` through the
diagnostics surface.
