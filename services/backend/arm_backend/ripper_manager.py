"""Ripper manager: one durable container per *enrolled* drive (spec §3).

Mirrors transcode_dispatcher's docker-py usage (label-based tracking,
boot-time reconcile) with two differences in kind: rippers are durable
(`restart_policy: unless-stopped`, never `auto_remove`) so docker keeps them
up and the backend only decides whether they should exist; and they always
run on the *local* daemon — the drive is plugged into this host, so
ARM_TRANSCODE_DOCKER_HOST never applies.

Every method is synchronous (callers use asyncio.to_thread) and raises only
RipperManagerError for docker/transport failures.
