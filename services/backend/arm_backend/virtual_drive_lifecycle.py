"""Rip from ISO: the virtual-drive lifecycle (spec 6.2).

A virtual drive is created `enrolled` with a one-shot ripper container
(restart policy "no") and becomes `retired` once that rip ends. The ripper
just exits; this module's watchdog owns the cleanup. `sweep_virtual_drives`
runs every 30 seconds as a lifespan task and once at boot, before
`reconcile_enrolled_rippers` loads the enrolled list, so a finished ISO rip is
never respawned. A rip parked at a review gate is the one exception: its
ripper only heartbeats, so when a backend restart (or anything else) takes the
container away the watchdog starts it again and the ripper re-identifies
into the same job (`disc_dedupe` reuses a pre-rip job on the same drive),
within a crash-loop window and a budget of starts per hour.
