"""The episode stage (design spec 5, 6.2, 6.3, 9): match a TV disc's titles
against each ranked provider's episode list and record the result as one
tier-3 `SourceClaims` per provider.

`compute_episode_claims` only reads: it never adds to the session or writes
the job, except that `resolve_show_ids` caches newly found show ids on the job
when `opts.apply` is set. `run_episode_stage` stores every outcome with
`put_source`, then runs the resolver; the caller commits.

A result the stage is not sure of (ambiguous positions, low coverage, low
confidence, two seasons that fit about equally, nominal broadcast-slot
runtimes) is stored with `suggestion=True`, which the resolver applies as a
guess (`Resolution.episode_unsure`, held countdown, amber in the UI), and
`extra["hold_reasons"]` names every reason (`episode_holds.hold_reasons`).

With no known season, every season the provider lists is fetched, in
`season_scan_order`: the disc hint's season, then seasons sibling discs hold,
then the rest. Only a hint- or sibling-proposed season can stop the scan
early, and only when its fit would apply on its own.

    applying stale outcomes to a row a concurrent PATCH/resolve has since
    changed would silently revert that edit.

    (`resolver.resolve`) applies a held "ok" result as a guess and reports
    it through `episode_unsure`, rather than this stage rewriting the stored
    claim (and a same-inputs error that makes `put_source` keep the prior
    good "ok" entry stays applicable too, per F8)."""
