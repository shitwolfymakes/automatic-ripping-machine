"""Phase 8: shared apply-session core + rip-complete auto-apply hook.

`apply_session_internal` is the engine behind both code paths:
  * `POST /api/jobs/{id}/transcode` — manual click in the UI.
  * `_maybe_auto_apply_session` — fired from `rip-complete` when a session is
    ROUTED to the job (`resolve_routed_session_id`: pending choice, else the
    compatibility-gated drive default, else `session_routes`) and
    `auto_apply_allowed` says unattended queueing is permitted.

Both paths emit a single `session.queued` WS event on success with the
`source` field set to `"manual"` or `"auto"` so the UI can render where each
in-flight transcode came from.

Auto-apply failures never bubble out: a deleted session, a template that
resolves to an empty token, a path collision, or a session/job media_type
incompatibility all log at WARN and let the caller's HTTP response succeed
unchanged. The user can still hand-apply the session afterwards.
