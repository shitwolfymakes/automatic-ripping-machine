    from the apply path):
      1. `job.pending_session_id` - explicit per-rip choice.
      2. `drive.default_session_id` - the persistent per-drive default, but
         ONLY when it's compatibility-gated: the drive default wins when
         the routing media type (`routing_media_type`: the job's
         media_type, or music for a CD) is None (nothing to disagree with
         yet) OR the
         drive-default session's media_type is `media_types_compatible`

         job) it's skipped in favor of steps 3-4 - a drive default must not
         permanently swallow a media type it was never meant for (G-17). A
         dangling `default_session_id` (the session row no longer exists)
         also falls through to routes, logged at DEBUG.
      3. `session_routes` row matching `(job.media_type, job.disc_type)` exactly.
      4. `session_routes` wildcard row matching `(job.media_type, NULL)`.
      5. None.
    Steps 3-4 are skipped when the routing media type is None (a
    never-identified non-CD disc) - a route is keyed on media_type, so there
    is nothing to match. No
    `auto_transcode_on_idle` gating: routing shapes the rip and the preview;
    whether rip-complete may QUEUE the routed session unattended is
