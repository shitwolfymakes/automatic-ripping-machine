    soon-to-be-reused `paths`.

    Called on the overwrite=True branch of manual apply. We delete the
    QUEUED/DONE/FAILED rows at those paths so the new fan-out doesn't
    trip the partial unique index on `output_path`. IN_PROGRESS at the
    same path is a hard refusal — a live transcoder is actively writing
    and can't be safely displaced; the user should cancel that task
    explicitly first.

    Scoped to `job_id`: eviction only ever removes tasks that belong to
    applications owned by the job doing the applying (G-08). A collision
    owned by a *different* job is never reachable here — the caller filters
    those out and reports them as a hard `skipped_reason="collisions"`
    before this function is called, even when overwrite=True. Re-ripping a
    disc and overwriting must never silently destroy another job's finished
    output.

    Empty `session_applications` left behind (all their tasks evicted)
    get cleaned up here so the JobDetail page doesn't accumulate husk
    rows on every re-apply.
