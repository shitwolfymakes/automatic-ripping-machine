"""Single-invocation MakeMKV rip.

`rip_disc` shells out to `makemkvcon mkv ... all <outdir>` exactly once
per disc — the v2 pattern. The drive stays open for the entire rip, so
the between-titles SCSI NOT_READY / USB-autosuspend gap that plagued
the per-title implementation simply doesn't exist anymore.

Per-title attribution is reconstructed from the robot stream:
  - PRGC:5017 ("Saving to MKV file") lines fire once at the start of
    every title save; the second field is the *output position* (0-based)
    that matches the `_tNN.mkv` filename suffix and indexes into
    `eligible_source_indexes` to recover the source title index. This
    is the primary per-title milestone in `mkv all` mode (confirmed
    empirically against MakeMKV 1.18.3 — the older PRGT "Saving title
    #N" milestone never fires in this mode).
  - PRGV gives [0..1] fractional progress; `current/max` is per-title
    (drives `on_title_progress`), `total/max` is disc-overall (used as
    a fallback `on_disc_progress` for the brief window before the first
    PRGC:5017 arrives).
  - MSG:5003 lines tell us a title failed (with reason). We capture the
    title index from the args.
  - Post-exit, we walk `output_dir` for `title_tNN.mkv` files: a file
    that exists for an attempted title means success; an attempted
    title with no file means failure (reason from MSG:5003 if any,
    otherwise "no .mkv produced").

Tracks that were *not* attempted by makemkvcon (below `--minlength`)
never appear in the result map; the dispatcher decides what to do
with them (typically: mark FAILED with "skipped: below minlength").

    `hash_outputs=False` leaves `sha256` unset on every result: the
